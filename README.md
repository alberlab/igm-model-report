Reporting tool
==============

reporting based on a structure:

- create summary stats:
    - imposed hic restraints: 
        - cis / trans : *need to refactor igm code to keep track of those* 
        - distribution by chromosome : same
        - distribution by genomic distance : same
    - violations histograms by type: *ok*
    - histogram of number of restraint per bead: *need to keep track*

- create contact map and compare with the input
    - visual matrix images: *ok*
    - in/out scatter plot: *ok*
    - compute correlation: *ok*

- structural features:
    - summary stats:
        - average radius of each shell
        - total radius of gyration
    - plot of average number of neighbors per bead
    - histogram of number of neighbors
    - radius of gyration per chromosome

- radial positions
    - plots of radial positions per bead
    - plots of radial position per chromosome
    - identification of peaks and dips

- five shells analysis
    - ?

- damid
    - scatter plot in/out (or expected/out)
    - plots of damid profile by chromosome (so, what are we using here?)
